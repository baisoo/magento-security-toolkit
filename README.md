## What is The Magento Security Toolkit?

Our goal is to fill the gap between the understandably limited amount of technical detail published on security vulnerabilities that are responsibly disclosed by Researchers and the information supplied by Magento in their communications and associated software patches designed to address those vulnerabilities.  

We understand why it is necessary for all parties to behave in a deliberate and responsible manner when addressing concerns affecting the security of software that is so critically important to the livelihoods of millions of Merchants and their families around the world.  We are developing the Magento Security Toolkit to provide every member of the Magneto Community a set of tools and the knowledge required to effectively combat the security threats that target Magento.

We accomplish this through 2 main activities:

1. Developing a set of n98-magerun add-ons that can that do more than just check to see if you have applied a set of patches or that you have a specific version of Magento installed.  You will be able to use the MST to analyze your Magento codebase in the context of any malware, attack signatures, and known compromises that have been shared  by fellow professionals Magento Community.

2.  Providing a forum in which all Members of the Magneto Community are made welcome to share their knowledge from researching and addressing Magento security vulnerabilities.  We use the information in a responsible manner and we  use this repository to share the collective Wisdom earned through the difficult task of analyzing, researching, and responding to attacks against Magento software.
